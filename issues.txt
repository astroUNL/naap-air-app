*** Needs Fixing ***

Problem: textfields in interactives on background pages are sometimes inaccessible. Example: the sexagesimal converted at the bottom of Basic Coordinates and Seasons / Units of Longitude and Latitude. This problem is intermittent.

Other problem:

Lab					Interactive or Sim			Problem
===					==================			=======
The Rotating Sky			Locations of Objects in the Sky		Text on celestial sphere not rendered correctly (affects macOS only).


*** Will Not Fix ***

Lab					Interactive or Sim			Problem
===					==================			=======
The Rotating Sky			Rotating Sky Explorer			It is possible to change a constellation star’s location using the text fields (long standing bug — not AIR related).
Atmospheric Retention			Gas Retention Simulator			Cosmetic issue with gas combobox when limit reached — does not interfere with functionality.


*** Fixed ***

Lab					Interactive or Sim			Problem
===					==================			=======
Basic Coordinates and Seasons		Merdians				Requires flashvars.
Basic Coordinates and Seasons		Parallels of Latitude			Requires flashvars.
	-> Meridians and Parallels combined into new animation (see src/misc folder).
Hydrogen Energy Levels			Thermal Distribution Demo		“Level1” label appears as “NE”.
	-> Couldn't find original source file, so made an overlay movie with the correct label (see src/misc folder).
Cosmic Distance Ladder			Radar Pulse Demo			Size is incorrect. Too large. Also, doesn’t seem to work in NAAP AIR app.
