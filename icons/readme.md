The `naap-air-app-icons-v4b.ai` file was based on Devi's `v4/icons_final.ai` file (834.7 KB, 2020-01-29-1824), with these changes:
- The Interactives (ranking tasks) icons were removed.
- The artboards were positioned on integer coordinates to avoid issue where exported PNGs are not the correct size.
- The full sequence of 14 needed icons was created, with an artboard for each. This required making some duplicates, as well as sizing up copies for 256, 512, and 1024 pixels.
- The artboards were named as needed.
